and code for our presentation at the 12th International Epidemiology Workshop:

The slides of the presentation were prepared in Google Slides and can be found [on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/adamhsparks/whats-so-open-about-plant-pathology).

The code used to generate graphs that were presented at ANU can be found in
the [articles](https://openplantpathology.github.io/OPP.at.ANU/articles/sparks-anu-graphs-for-open-science-presentation.html).

The data are from <https://openplantpathology.github.io/Reproducibility_in_Plant_Pathology/>.

## How to use

### Install supporting package, hrbrthemes

Install `hrbrthemes`, which provides the theme for the `ggplot2` graphs and
loads the fonts.

Install the package and load it. Upon loading it follow the directions for
installing and loading Roboto Condensed fonts.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("hrbrthemes", dep = TRUE)
library(hrbrthemes)
```

Take note of these instructions and execute them and then install the font,
Roboto Condensed on your computer as directed.

### Install OPP.at.ANU

Now install the package using devtools and then use `browseVignettes` to see the
HTML version, the raw Rmd file and only the R code of the vignette locally.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
}

devtools::install_github("openplantpathology/OPP.at.ANU",
                         build_vignettes = TRUE,
                         dependencies = TRUE)

browseVignettes("OPP.at.ANU")
```
